# Grand Prize Boost Hook

Uses both hook calls to redirect all prizes won (except the GP) back to the prize pool and contribute them on behalf of this "vault", creating a continuous loop of contributions until this vault's chance slowly fades. The end result of this hook is to contribute as much capital as possible to the GP without creating a game-able opportunity.
